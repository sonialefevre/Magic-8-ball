# Magic-8-ball

Little personnal project to make a digital magic 8-ball using Reactjs.

## TO-DO:
- Add CSS transitions
  (Ideally answer to be displayed in a blue triangle that would spinn a few times before easing-in the answer)

- Deal with the input field size depending on user's input size

- Display question asked upon submit (maybe manage questions through a state? Seems overkill but possible troubleshooting...)

- Correct wrong proptyped (or switch to Redux?)

- Generally make it prettier (use a CSS framework because CSS is the devil's language?)

## TO-DO if I ever manage to make all of the above

- Try and deal none yes-no questions through Regex ?

- Add the possibility to add new answers should user not be satisfied with answer?

- Try and add new cateories and troll answers and have the user select a category before asking the question?
